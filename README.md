# OmniSeekers
## Description
We want to create a swarm of omnidirectional robots with the aim of carrying out Search-and-Rescue tasks without the use of GPS or mapping such as SLAM. For this reason, we have based ourselves on exploration techniques based on Bug Algorithms, specifically on the Swarm Gradient Bug Algorithm (SGBA), presented in the article "Minimal navigation solution for a swarm of tiny flying robots to explore an unknown environment"ยน. The objective of this project is to present an efficient solution for the search for victims and targets in indoor environments where human access can pose a risk. To carry out the coverage of an extensive space in a consistent time, we have considered that the use of techniques developed in the field of Swarm Robotics is very suitable for distributing the exploration task among different entities with relatively simple objectives. Furthermore, this approach allows us to use affordable controllers that in other cases where computation would be more expensive. For the recognition of victims and the global coordination of the robots, a central server will be used from which computer vision techniques and odometry handling will be applied.
